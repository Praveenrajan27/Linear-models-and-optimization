# Linear-models-and-optimization
This project is to build optimization techniques from scratch for Linear models
The notebook features building a classifier based on synthetic data and optimzation techniques like
1. Gradient descent
2. Stochastic Gradient descent
3. Stochastic Gradient descent with Momentum
4. RMSprop
